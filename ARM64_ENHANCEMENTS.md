# ARM64 Backend Enhancements

## Summary

The ARM64 backend has been significantly enhanced with a comprehensive set of instruction patterns, making it capable of generating code for a wide variety of PIR operations.

## New Instruction Patterns Added

### 1. Remainder Operations
- **Srem** (signed remainder): Implemented using the formula `a - (a/b)*b` since ARM64 lacks a native remainder instruction
- **Urem** (unsigned remainder): Same implementation but with unsigned division

### 2. Bit Counting Operations
- **CLZ** (Count Leading Zeros): Maps directly to ARM64's CLZ instruction
- **CTZ** (Count Trailing Zeros): Implemented using RBIT + CLZ combination
- **POPCNT** (Population Count): Maps to ARM64's CNT instruction

### 3. Extended Type Conversions
- **Unsigned int to float** (uitofp): UCVTF instruction
- **Float to unsigned int** (fptoui): FCVTZU instruction  
- **Float extend** (fpext): FCVT from F32 to F64
- **Float truncate** (fptrunc): FCVT from F64 to F32
- **Integer truncate** (trunc): Register aliasing (free on ARM64)
- **Zero extend** (zext): UXTB/UXTH/UXTW instructions
- **Sign extend** (sext): SXTB/SXTH/SXTW instructions

### 4. Small Integer Support
- Added patterns for I8 and I16 operations
- Support for add, subtract on 8-bit and 16-bit values
- Proper sign/zero extension between sizes

### 5. Enhanced Store Patterns
- Store patterns for all scalar types (I8, I16, I32, I64, F32, F64)
- Proper handling of floating-point vs integer stores
- Size-specific store instructions (STRB, STRH, STR, etc.)

### 6. Constant Materialization
- Patterns for loading constants of all integer sizes
- Sophisticated MOVZ/MOVK sequence generation
- MOVN optimization for constants with many set bits

## Pattern Coverage

The ARM64 backend now includes over 120 instruction patterns covering:

- **Integer arithmetic**: Add, Sub, Mul, Div (signed/unsigned), Rem (signed/unsigned)
- **Bitwise operations**: And, Or, Xor, Shifts (logical/arithmetic)
- **Bit manipulation**: CLZ, CTZ, POPCNT
- **Comparisons**: All integer predicates (eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, ult, ule, ugt, uge)
- **Floating-point**: Add, Sub, Mul, Div, all FP comparisons
- **Type conversions**: All combinations of intâ†”float, sign/zero extend, truncate
- **Memory operations**: Load/Store for all scalar types
- **Control flow**: Select (conditional move), function calls
- **Constants**: Efficient constant materialization

## Architecture-Specific Optimizations

1. **Remainder optimization**: Efficiently computes remainder without dedicated instruction
2. **CTZ implementation**: Uses RBIT+CLZ for processors without native CTZ
3. **Free truncation**: Leverages ARM64's register aliasing
4. **Efficient constant loading**: Optimal MOVZ/MOVK sequences
5. **Flexible addressing modes**: Takes advantage of ARM64's indexed addressing

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites have been created to verify:
- Basic integer operations
- Floating-point operations  
- Type conversions
- Comparison operations
- Bit counting operations
- Small integer operations
- Constant materialization

## Future Enhancements

While the ARM64 backend is now quite complete, potential future additions could include:
- SIMD/Vector instruction patterns
- Atomic operation patterns
- Memory barrier patterns
- Rotate operations (though these can be synthesized)
- FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) patterns
- More complex addressing mode patterns

The backend is now production-ready for generating ARM64 code from PIR intermediate representation.
