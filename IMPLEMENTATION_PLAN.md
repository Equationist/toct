```

## Development Workflow

1. **Implement Module**: Write core functionality
2. **Add Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/APIs
3. **Run Tests**: `dune runtest` - must pass before proceeding
4. **Commit Progress**: Git commit with test results
5. **Integration**: Test with other modules if applicable
6. **Update Plan**: Mark progress and note any issues

## Key Design Decisions

1. **SSA with Block Parameters**: Uses block parameters instead of phi nodes for cleaner representation
2. **Attribute-driven optimization**: JSON annotations guide optimization decisions
3. **Pluggable passes**: Modular architecture allows research extensions
4. **Compact core**: Minimal instruction set with synthetic sugar
5. **Test-driven development**: Tests written alongside implementation

## Technical Specifications

- **Frontend helpers**: ≤3k LOC total
- **Backend pipeline**: ≤7.5k LOC
- **Compile time**: <0.15s for 50k LOC input
- **Performance target**: 94-97% of GCC -O2 on integer workloads
- **Languages**: Pure OCaml (no C stubs except optional runtime)
- **Test coverage**: >90% for core modules

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1: Set up project structure and build system WITH tests
2. Implement core PIR data structures WITH unit tests
3. Create PIR builder and utilities WITH unit tests
4. Validate with integration tests before proceeding to optimization passes
